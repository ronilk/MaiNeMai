Pass the Pillow game using events in .Net
A number of players participate in this game. They sit forming a circle. A pillow is given to any random player and music 
is started. As long as the music is played the pillow is passed from one player to the next. When the music stops, the player
who has the pillow in his hand is out of the game. The game continues untill there is only one player left who is the winner.
